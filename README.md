Hi my name is Rachel otherwise known here as rockymiss.  My interest in technology began in the last century when you needed a small bedroom to house a computer screen. I started out studying computer programming in college in 1997 however as we all know life does not always provide a straight road and I took a few detours.  At this point in my life, I’m glad my road wasn’t straight.   

Since November 2021 I have been immersing myself back into the world of technology by doing a Diploma in Software Development with the Code Institute. Not only have I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python in that time, I have created projects, taken part in hackathons and have worked with some wonderful and talented people along the way. I've plenty more to learn and with some hard work I will finish the course in November 2022.
